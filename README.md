# Web-Scraping-Challenge

For this assignment, I used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape four websites and extract static information. All of this was completed in a Jupyter notebook, but I converted it to a .py file to make it return the data scraped as a part of a function. After that, I built a Flask app to perform the actual scraping and then return it to a web page which was built to contain the data.

The web page has static fields which, before the scraping is completed, look like a garbled mess of text. After the scraping is completed, the return populates images, text, and a table.

The finished product works with mongo db titled 'mars_app' and collection name 'collection'
